While working as a signal operator for East African Railways, he was inspired to feed arriving visitors while preparing packaged meals for those preparing to depart. Singh Restaurant was born. Since then, Singh Restaurant has fed generations of people from various walks of life... Providing lunches and dinners for entire groups of workers, for families, for individuals... And becoming one of the most popular tourist destinations in the region, and drawing visitors from nearby cities such as Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Our success comes from high quality in all aspects of our business, from the food we serve, to our operational efficiency, to the atmosphere we provide our visitors from the moment they walk in, until the moment they depart. Our quality of food and quality of service has helped Singh Restaurant gain recognition as the most highly recommended Indian restaurant in Mombasa by sources including TripAdvisor and Lonely Planet.","Lunch","Dinner","Late Night",,,,"Chili","Curry","Prawns","Fish",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Restaurants",,"Takeout","Seating","Wheelchair Accessible","Reservations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Africa/Nairobi","870","720","1320","1140",,,,,"870","720","1320","1140","870","720","1320","1140","870","720","1320","1140","870","720","1320","1140","870","720","1320","1140","2283276","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/3c/b8/0f/singh-restaurant.jpg","false","false","-4.056649",,"","Mombasa, Coast Province","39.6675","Lunch","Dinner","Late Night",,,,,"Singh Restaurant","141","Open Now",,"+254 723 735881","45","$$ - $$$","KES 889 - KES 1,779","144","6","#6 of 188 places to eat in Mombasa","4.5","0","1","6","52","82","3.883434534072876","Sit down","RESTAURANT","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294210-d2283276-Reviews-Singh_Restaurant-Mombasa_Coast_Province.html","http://www.facebook.com/SinghRestaurant1962/"

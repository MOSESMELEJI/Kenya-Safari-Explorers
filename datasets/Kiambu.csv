What makes RocoMamas® unique is how they prepare their burgers. Patties are rolled up into a ball and pushed flat onto the grill to maximize the flavors and seal in the juices. You haven’t had a real burger until you’ve tried a “smashed burger” — trust us!. Customers can also choose to ‘build’ their own burgers by ticking items from our burgers menu, and you can even give your new burger a name.

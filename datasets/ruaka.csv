Upstairs are two lounges which guarantee total privacy. They are tastily furnished and equipped with flat screen television sets. A waiter at hand provides tailor made services and trained to spoil one with choice. The boardroom with a balcony offers a bird-eye view of the expansive lush green garden surrounded by century-old trees and variety of well tended flower beds. Designed at two teir levels, the gardens is ideal for family dinning, social functions such as corporate parties and weddings. The picture is not complete without the welcoming terrace bar with an L shaped counter. It is stocked with every conceivable brands of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. The coffee shops offers mouth watering pastry and bitings.

We like to say Cultiva is more than a restaurant, it's a family. The pillars of the establishment are based on the same principles. Respect, honesty and compassion.

Guests are invited to a culinary experience through an ever-changing menu that is dependent on the produce available on the farm. It’s a farm to table restaurant that grows vegetables, micro herbs and edible flowers, and the serves them along side some of Kenya’s finest organic produce and creations from their kitchen.","Nairobi","false",,"restaurant","19292723","sales@cultivakenya.com","40","833","Cultiva Farm Kenya","4.5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Africa/Nairobi","1380","480",,,,,,,,,,,"1380","720",,,,,"1380","480",,,,,"1380","480",,,,,"1380","480",,,,,"1380","480",,,,,"Pofu Road, Nairobi Kenya","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294207-d19292723-Reviews-Cultiva_Farm_Kenya-Nairobi.html","-1.356984","36.739162","Lunch","Breakfast","Dinner","Brunch","Drinks",,"Lunch","Breakfast","Dinner","Brunch","Drinks",,"Reservations","Outdoor Seating","Seating","Parking Available","Street Parking","Serves Alcohol","Full Bar","Wine and Beer","Free Wifi","Accepts Credit Cards",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ceviche","Burger","Tacos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
